In this project, I analyzed the 2018 Kaggle ML & DS Survey Dataset. 

I wanted to look if there is any difference in learning methods and resources between students and nonstudents. Does working experience influence the choice of media sources, learning platforms or not? What respondents think about online learning?

The analysis was done in Jupyter notebook. Used libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.

Full exploratory analysis and visualization can be found in the 'kernel.ipunb' above.

Summary:

- There is no significant difference between Students and nonStudents in this survey. All respondents use mostly the same learning resources and methods.
- It is better to invest time and efforts into independents projects as most of the nonStudents find them much or slightly more important than academic achievements.
- Most of the respondents have a better opinion about Online learning platforms and MOOCs than about Traditional institution.
Nevertheless, it is expected that a Data Scientist has at least a Bachelor degree, even better Master or Doctoral degree.

The notebook was published on Kaggle 12/02/2018. (https://www.kaggle.com/marlukyanova/students-and-nonstudents-preferences-in-learning)
